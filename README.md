# CATALOG APP

A functional Catalog App. Developed using **flutter framework** (Dart). Uses **Google Firebase** for back-end storage and authentication. Also includes a payment gateway: **Razorpay** (only for India). Supports **dark theme** too.

## Light-Theme

The Light-Theme is the default theme of this app. The theme uses colors which are soothing to your eye. The font is also appropriately adjusted to give you a rich feeling. If you favour Dark-Theme over Light-Theme, you can always switch to it from settings in hamburger menu. I have also added persistence. That means, once you switch to dark-theme, the next time you open the app, it will still be in Dark-Theme. 

## Dark-Theme

Who doesn't love Dark-Theme? This particular theme is inspired from Google Material Design. Background colors and foreground colors are chosen in such a way that makes the upper layer elements stand out. The colors are not too dark and not too light. One of the best themes I could come up with for this app :)
